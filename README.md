STUFF TO FIX!

Editing is a little weird:

 Starting an edit doesn't use the current post for defaults; instead, everything is blank

 Even if you cancel editing a post, the edited text you typed will display until you refresh
 
 Even if you submit a post edit, the duedate and status won't update until you refresh
