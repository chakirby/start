STUFF TO FIX!

When posting, the status is posted as null, so it doesn't show up in-post

When editing a post's text, the post will appear to update even if you press Cancel

  (if you make it show post text while editing you can see it gets updated in real time)
  
  (it doesn't really edit, as shown when refreshing, but yeah idk)

Navbar buttons don't work
