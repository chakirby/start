Yay:\n
took base posting code, fixed various errors and stuff that isn't necessary for our purposes\n
added status buttons when posting and made their data fields\n

Not Yay:\n
When posting, the status is posted as null, so it doesn't show up in-post\n
When editing a post's text, the post will appear to update even if you press Cancel\n
  (if you make it show post text while editing you can see it gets updated in real time)\n
  (it doesn't really edit, as shown when refreshing, but yeah idk)\n
